Maybe not quite a 5 star book but 4 feels too low.\r\n\r\nReaders of John Dies At The End (or its sequel) will certainly recognize Wong's style here, but this book is really quite different, in setting and in structure. While JDATE was a contemporary horror-comedy with a gangly, tangent-filled structure, this is a near-future thriller with a tight, linear, fast-paced plot.  This isn't necessarily better - I quite liked the anything-goes weirdness of JDATE - but it certainly feels more developed and mature (in the sense of honing one's craft).\r\n\r\nThe book follows a protagonist, Zoey Ashe, who is suddenly transported from a poor, unglamorous, trailer-park existence into the world of her recently deceased estranged biological father - a billionaire power-elite who is at the center of some very bizarre and very dangerous dealings that Zoey suddenly needs to deal with herself.  Needless to say, life in the trailer park with her stripper mother hasn't prepared her very well for the task, and Wong gets a huge amount of both humor and drama from Zoey's fish-out-of-water situation; a poor young woman in a powerful rich man's world. Zoey is a great creation, although most other characters are presented as archetypes, albeit with hints of underlying complexity and humanity. I'll say that, occasionally, it felt like I was reading a movie pitch; this is custom made for the big screen, I think, with plenty of bits and scenes that would clearly *look* awesome and a pace and linearity that would be easy to adapt.\r\n\r\nI should emphasize that, primarily, this is first and foremost a zingy, snarky, fast-paced, tongue-in-cheek thriller and a fun read.

Newest book from David Wong, and this time it is a sci-fi comedy thriller I think. I'm terrible at genres. It takes place in the near future where social media is completely invasive and people have access to incredible technology. The bulk of the story takes place in a city called Tabula Ra$a where people with more money than sense have created a city free from laws where they can do anything they please. Buildings go up and come down constantly and the streets are filled with vendors for every food drink and drug you can imagine. Pretty sure someone was fighting a bear in the park in one scene.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the writing is similar to Wong's other books, so if you enjoy them, you'll enjoy this. This isn't a John and Dave adventure, and isn't horror, but I would really enjoy seeing more of this world.\";s:6:\"rating\";d:5;s:5:\"likes\";i:6;}i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:701:\"This book is amazing.

I became obsessed with his writing while reading John Dies at the End (also fantastic) and the writing in his second novel still haunts me to this day (in a good way.)  If you want a unique reading experience that will leave you so fulfilled and wishing there was so so much more, this is exactly what you should be buying. Do it now. Don't wait. Stop.

The plot moves briskly, everything ties in beautifully and yet most of the plot twists are unpredictable. The book resembles William Gibson's recent The Peripheral in that it involves an impoverished young woman in the near future thrust into the dangerous world of the extremely rich, and relying on her own wits and the experience of various employees and agents of the upper classes to survive. Frankly, I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed The Peripheral, and I'm giving five stars with the following caveats:\r\n1. Many of the earnest characters sound the same as each other, and many of the snarky characters sound the same as each other, and\r\n2. The ending is a bit of deus ex machina.\r\n\r\nMuch of the development feels cinematic, and I bet this book is made into a movie.

I'm not new to David Wong's sense of humor or knack for the strange storytelling, but this book caught me by surprise. I've come to know that Wong's humor is abrupt, childish, and satisfying (particularly when he sets a joke up in an early chapter, just to get to the punchline near the end of the story). I loved this book and here's why.\r\n\r\nLikes:\r\nI have to start off by saying I really liked Will Blackwater. Not only is he a \"dead-eyed robot\" with a proclivity for intense bulls***ting, but he's smart, quick, clever, and an alcoholic with a love for suits. He's a ridiculous character, right down to his name, which is joked about in the book itself.\r\n\r\nI also really liked Zoey Ashe. She was somehow relatable without actually being relatable to me personally AT ALL. She's an abuse survivor who wants nothing to do with her dead-beat father, has unconditional love for her kinda-effed-up mother, and her closest relationship is with her cat, who she named Stench Machine.\r\n\r\nThe other characters (the Suits: Echo, Budd, and Andre; Molech and his crew; the League of Badasses; etc.) are really interesting and fun characters also. I know there is no romance in the book, but I couldn't help picturing a Will\/Zoey relationship, which made all their scenes together even better. Who cares if he's almost 20 years older than her? I pictured him younger.\r\n\r\nThe storyline is a big high point for me, also. The blurb's I've read for this book are extremely vague. I can't believe such a good story stems from such a bad blurb. Honestly. Zoey lives in the middle of nowhere with a minimum wage job and no idea what she's doing tomorrow, let alone with the rest of her life.

It subtle explores the themes of violence against women within the frame work of masculinity, the dehumanizing affects of massive wealth on those who possess it, and the impact of just around the corner technology. Stylistically it does a wonderful job flirting with the super hero genre just enough to make you buy into the conventions before yanking the rug out from under your feet.\r\n\r\nSo, high level premise: Zoey Ashe is the only living off-spring of an absurdly rich man, Arthur Livingston, whom she has been estranged from her entire life. One day he dies in a warehouse explosion and she is willed his entire vast, vast fortune of ill gotten gains and his continued criminal enterprise. That inheritance comes with complications in the form of an alpha male villain named Molech and his posse of technologically enhanced followers. This all takes place with the desert libertarian utopia (dystopia for many) city of Tabla Ra$a.\r\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the story itself. Wong does a wonderful job populating it with very colorful bordering on appropriately absurd characters. The Suits, Arthur Livingston's inner circle of confidants were fantastic, and Armando, Zoey's private body guard, was as cool as a glacier. But the heart of the story was Zoey, a somewhat damaged young woman who was just worrying about how to make ends meet and keep the trailer she and her mother lived in livable. She is thrown into the madness that is Tabla Ra$a and Arthur Livingston's world and has to cope with deranged people trying to kill her for something she has no connection to or idea about, but merely because of who she is. She is sometimes defiant, sometimes overwhelmed, sometimes completely confused, but she always stays true to her self and tries to do the best she can, even if it is only to spit into the face of fate:   \"So, here is how this is going to go. I'm going to bite you eight times. Those bites will sever eight tendons, and they will render your legs and arms both inoperable. Then, over the course of days and weeks, I will slowly, and completely at random-\"\r\n\"No.\"\r\nZoey crossed her arms.\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\"No. I'm not doing this. I'm not running and screaming, I'm not letting you put on a slasher movie chase for your creeper fans...I'm not giving you a show. I'm sick of it... I've done nothing but run for the last eight hours. I'm done with that. I don't run anymore...\r\n\"You've got quite a mouth on you. And I'm going to cut out that tongue and eat it in front of you. Bu first I'm going to-\"\r\n\"No. You don't get to monologue for you audience. You're not cool, you're not menacing.\" \r\n\"I don't think you're in any position to tell me what-\"\r\n \"LA LA LA LA LA NOBODY CAN HEAR YOU! LA LA LA!\"  She might not be in total control of her fate, but that doesn't mean she will go down without a fight. Throughout the story we see time and again a resolve in Zoey that she didn't even know she had.\r\n\r\nThe writing is also quite excellent. Wong is quite adept at getting into the minds of characters and determining a reasonable outlook for them. For instance, one of the few cops who still works in Tabla Ra$a had this to say about the erstwhile heroes going after Molech:   \"Oh, so you're still trying to fight this guy. Got it. You have any special requests for me when I process your corpse tomorrow? And don't ask us not to make fun of your dick, because we do that with every body that comes through, it's how we cope.\" Here is this overworked, cynical policeman from an understaffed department hearing that some of his acquaintances are taking on the equivalent of a suicide mission and his response, in my mind, is pitch perfect.\r\n\r\nWong also shows that he knows exactly what drives the motivations of cats as well:   Zoey let [her cat] out if his crate. He prowled the area around her bench, hoping to find a bird to eat. He wasn't much of a hunter, so when he saw no birds had died of natural causes within five feet of the bench, he just gave up and lay down in the dirt. His dialogue is great, the way he describes Tabla Ra$a shows great vision, and he avoids any mid-book plot dragging.\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see from the above quote, Zoey has a bit of violence directed against her. In fact the main villain of the story, Molech, pretty much represents the masculine ideal gone terribly, terribly wrong. He brays about living for the juice, the natural high a person experiences when they achieve something that helps ensure their survival (in his mind). He rails against modern society substituting the juice with cheap thrills like pornography and video games that enslave man to society. Think Tyler Durden from Fight Club without the charisma or compassion or introspection. Molech believes that women are nothing more than trophies to be acquired from alpha males and that those that do not live up to his ideal are fair game for killing. \r\n\r\nHe identifies this violence and disregard for human (especially female) life as a keystone of authentic masculinity. If a man does not conform to them then, in Molech's mind, they are merely prey. He is quite clear about the many terrible things he will do to her and her mother if she does not comply with his demands. And unlike internet trolls and MRA jackasses, he backs this up with a cult of followers who feel likewise and advanced augmentation technology he stole from Arthur Livingston. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting theme Wong explores is how wealth affects those who hold it. Arthur Livingston, by all accounts of people who interacted with him, was a very warm and gracious man. He threw tons of parties with an open invite list, gave freely, and never raised a hand to a woman. But he was also massively wealthy and do extremely unscrupulous things to maintain and expand that wealth. During a period of unrest in North Korea he provides aid to displaced families while secretly recruiting the best looking young women to become prostitutes stateside. He cared little for what ended up happening to them (often a young death to violence) just so long as the money kept rolling in. \r\n\r\nLikewise one of his lieutenants, Will, is very good at manipulating people during negotiations. He is more than willing to sacrifice other people to achieve his goals with nary an eye lash batted. He operates in the same economic stratosphere that Livingston does and doesn't view the little people as people, merely pieces to be moved, manipulated, and sacrificed in whatever game he is playing. \r\n\r\nContrasted with Zoey who, until Livingston died, was one of the little, worthless people. She is able to show compassion and empathy for the normal citizens of Tabla Ra$a. She cares that their city is under attack by Molech and his madmen. She tries to use her wealth to uplift the people or at least give them a better life. She hasn't been severed from human contact by vast wealth and high stakes deal making. \r\n\r\nI think this is contrast isn't just existent in the book, but exists in the real world as well. We can only conceptualize so many people as actually being people. The people within our empathetic sphere we can deeply care for on a personal level. Beyond that humans are just broad brush strokes of demographics. When the super rich reach a point where they are power over those people and no accountability to them or empathetic link, bad things happen. Bad things like what occur in this book.\r\n\r\nOne pretty great thing Wong does with this book is add in some new technologies and extrapolate the impacts they would have on human society. For instance there are tons of drones everywhere in Tabla Ra$a, either providing surveillance, delivering food, or just streaming interesting things. Smart, self driving cars are the norm. Advances in recording and broadcasting technology allows for literally everyone to be able to broadcast their day to day life in a searchable format (called the Blink network). So if you wanted to see some fight that occurred or an embarrassing celebrity event there is a good chance there were several people \"blinking\" it. People can amass huge blink followers which naturally leads to people willing to do ANYTHING to achieve that fleeting fame. all these technologies and more smartly informed the story and produced a believable just-around-the-corner look at what these technologies might do for us.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, if you like speculative fiction with a wicked sense of humor, lots of action, a social message, and a good grasp on how technology affects society this book is for you.    \";s:6:\"rating\";i:4;s:5:\"likes\";i:34;}i:2;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:5759:\"Full disclosure.

On the flip side, There was also some really incredible shit in here as well, so I could get all fired up over a nice, fat, five-star rating too!\r\n\r\nBut it's not a five. It's not, grilled cheese sandwiches with smoked paprika turkey on them, level kind of shit.\r\n\r\nSo what is it?\r\n\r\nThere were times that, as I was reading this, I kept thinking in my head, \"man, this David Wong dude is writing his pants off right now! This is off the charts material!\" Like - there was so much that I wanted to quote on my status updates, so everyone could see how fucking funny it was, but it wouldn't fit because the lead up to it, for it to actually make sense, was just way to long.\r\n\r\ncheck it out:\r\nI just want to tell you a story, if you\u2019ll indulge me. Now this city, it can be real confusing for an outsider. I don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from, Tabula Rasa can make you feel like you\u2019ve taken a train to Bizarro world. I remember my very first night here\u2014and this is goin\u2019 on fifteen years ago\u2014I was takin\u2019 a walk downtown, tryin\u2019 to get a feel for the place. And I\u2019m walkin\u2019 through a construction site\u2014and it was all construction sites back then, you understand\u2014and I come across this hole in the ground, \u2019bout ten feet in diameter. I look down and I can\u2019t see a bottom, so I pull a quarter out of my pocket and toss it down, and listen for a clink or a splash. Nothin\u2019. Coin just tumbles into the darkness and disappears. So now I\u2019m real curious, and I look around for somethin\u2019 else to throw down there. And teeterin\u2019 right on the edge of the hole is an old refrigerator. So, I circle around and I give it a good kick and it tumbles down into the hole. I hear it bang off the side a few times but once again, there\u2019s no crash, no splash, like it just kept fallin\u2019 forever. It was the strangest thing. So I figure this is the first of this city\u2019s many unknowable mysteries and I start to go on about my way. But then I see the second strange thing\u2014this goat, it goes flying past me, in midair. Like it was fired from a cannon. And now I think I\u2019m losin\u2019 my mind, like maybe it\u2019s not just tobacco in my cigar, if you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. So I walk along and I come across a guy sittin\u2019 on the curb and I say, \u2018Holy cow, partner, did you see that goat?\u2019 And the fella says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s my goat.\u2019 And I say, \u2018Well, I hate to tell ya, but I think it\u2019s gone. It took off flyin\u2019.\u2019 And the fella says, \u2018That\u2019s impossible. I had him chained to a refrigerator.\u2019 \u201d\r\n\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nAnd the book is full of gems like that.\r\n\r\nIt was a hell of a lot of fun to read. If there are to be any more books...which there could or couldn't be...I'm their hands down.\r\n\r\nBut I got a thing. And I think it's a fairly legit thing. I got this problem, and I see it a lot. It is enough to make me DNF a book. For reals. Luckily this book, though guilty of my thing, upholds everything else to a standard of awesomeness that blows my brain.\r\n\r\nMy thing.\r\n\r\nI hate reading the dialogue in a novel like its a script.\r\n\r\nJon said, \"blah, blah, blah.\"\r\nJane said, \"More blah, blah blah.\"\r\nJon said, \"blah, blah.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that's a paragraph. Some descriptive text in the next paragraph and then back to the script-style dialogue.\r\n\r\nIt annoys the shit out of me. If I am reading a novel, I don't want to feel like I am reading a script. Immerse me motherfuckers. Pull me in. That kind of writing is lazy and only detracts my involvement from the story.\r\n\r\nAnd there are a lot of people that write that way. Even more discouragingly, there are a lot of readers that don't seem to be bothered by it either.\r\n\r\nI don't get it.\r\n\r\nThis was a five-star book, but I'm sorry, I gotta take one of those stars and tuck it back in my underbritches. The writing was rock solid, on point, and I loved the majority of it, but the execution of dialogue just really irked me at times.\r\n\r\nThis is a personal preference (I guess), and four stars is still an EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK kinda shout out, it's just that it could have been...should have been...five stars.\r\n\r\nThis is long. \r\n\r\nSee what happens when I eat grilled cheese?    \";s:6:\"rating\";i:4;s:5:\"likes\";i:21;}i:3;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:3711:\"This was the best fart\/poop\/butt joke book collection I've ever read that also happens to have a plot.\r\n\r\nDespite it not being exactly everything I hoped it would be, this book had me about three pages in when the heroine (ordering fast food while sitting in her self-driving car) contemplates how did people ever \"eat their car chili\" if they had to keep their hands on the steering wheel.

This girl clearly has her priorities straight. If the future allows me to eat car chili while cruising down the street, I will forgive it a lot.\r\n\r\nI was promised something like Ready Player One going in, but aside from a near future setting and a superficial plot detail (main character and an inheritance from a wealthy man), I really don't think the two books could be any more different. Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits delivers on the promise of its title. Zoey Ashe lives in a trailer park with her mother when the sudden death of her biological father catapults her life into violent chaos. Turns out her father was Arthur Livingston, one of the most wealthy men in the world, and his home base the city of Tabula Ra$a, a playground without rules. His death paints a huge target on his daughter, and she ends up involved with his henchman, who all wear fancy suits and are very into violence, who she isn't even sure she can trust, but who are her only protection from the very violent and possibly superpowered men who are after her.\r\n\r\nThe book also takes place in a world where social media is taken to its logical extreme: there are cameras everywhere, recording almost everything, and it's all constantly live. This makes it even harder for Zoey to stay safe, when the whole world is watching and waiting eagerly for events to transpire.\r\n\r\nThe thing I liked best about the book was how funny it was. Of course, humor is subjective, but if the car chili thing struck you right, you think it's funny for a cat to be named \"Stench Machine,\" and gems like this do it for you:\r\n\u201cZoey didn\u2019t want to be paranoid, but there was something about the man in the loincloth made of charred doll heads that made her nervous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want no part of this nonsense. This whole city is a butt that farts horror.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe thanked the toilet, but it did not respond. That was good\u2014if she started to think of it as a sentient being, it would probably be much harder to poop in its mouth.\u201d\r\n You'll probably think the rest of the book is great.\r\n\r\nI also ended up quite fond of most of the characters by the end, even though the constant action and danger was kind of tiring. I probably would have given this five stars with a little more breathing room, more emotions. But Wong's style seems to be fast-paced, quippy, humor-driven plot, and he is very self-assured in his execution. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that this book includes heaping portions of social criticism, mostly concerning poverty and wealth, and the dangers of toxic masculinity.

It\u2019s a rowdy, rollicking geekfest that starts out as fast as a roller coaster and picks up speed with each chapter. \r\n\r\nAs the story opens, twenty-two year-old Colorado trailer park resident Zoey Ashe is about to get more than her allotted 15 minutes in the national spotlight. Her trip to the Wendy\u2019s drive-thru is interrupted by an attempted assassination, which results in her flight via train to Tabula Ra$a, a lawless boom town in the desert of western Utah (think Vegas on acid-laced steroids) where, after more assassination attempts and a kidnapping attempt, she learns that her estranged father, gangster-turned-real estate mogul Arthur Livingston has died violently in an explosion leaving Zoey, for reasons I\u2019ll let you discover for yourself, on the run with a multi-million dollar bounty on her head. \r\n\r\nAll this, which takes place in the first 36 pages, is what readers will eventually recognize as the slow parts. \r\n\r\nWhat fascinates me is that, at the heart of the story is a preview of social technology\u2019s future that is as plausible as it is frightening. \u2018Blink\u2019 is a social network that combines the immediacy of Twitter with the video technology of GoPro and Google Glass. If 24-hour news channels scare you, imagine \u2018millions of live feeds broadcasting from glasses and pinned-on cameras, in addition to most car dashboard cams (standard on every new model since 2020) and a swarm of aerial drones owned by police departments, TV News channels, and tens of thousands of random voyeurs\u2019 provide a constant video stream that allow Blinkers, to watch any person, place or event (newsworthy or otherwise) \u2018in real time, the view hopping from one feed to the next\u2019, automatically switching to the feed with the best view of the event as it happens. Anyone with a camera is now a newscaster and anyone desiring his 15 minutes of fame has an audience of millions if his stunt is dramatic enough. In FV&amp;FS, The Hunt for Arthur Livingston\u2019s Daughter is the story of the day and everybody in Tabula Ra$a wants to get the best shot of the action.\r\n\r\nIf the book has a weakness, it is that many of the characters are two-dimensional. They have as much depth built in to do what they were written to do, and not much more.\r\n\r\nBy now I assume you get the idea. The story is rocking, raucous, rollicking and very violent. I really enjoyed it, except for those moments when the author decided to kill off characters that I liked. If you like your reading laced with adrenaline, you will too.\r\n\r\n*Quotations are cited from an advanced reading copy and may not be the same as appears in the final published edition.

The words I have to write about this book are not the ones I wish they were.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by stating that I'm a huge fan of David Wong and I wanted to love this book.\r\nThe new setting and characters he's created for FUTURISTIC VIOLENCE &amp; FANCY SUITS (FV&amp;FS) seem like they could be a lot of fun, so I was ready to follow him on his first novel-length fictional outing sans John and Dave.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there are signs throughout the book that point to this endeavor as being a rushed production. Both JOHN DIES AT THE END and THIS BOOK IS FULL OF SPIDERS were uneven in spots - the former particularly so - but the moments of sheer brilliance and hilarity scattered throughout more than made up for the rough prose and bumpy plotholes.\r\n\r\nFV&amp;FS has a strong opening, briefly leading me to believe that David Wong had unleashed his inner Douglas Adams; however, the book quickly devolves into a messy collage of lengthy expository dialogues that are nowhere as sharp or witty as they strive so hard to be.\r\n\r\nThe book's villains started out as somewhat interesting tech-heavy Mad Max warlord-types, but midway through the characterization became so one dimensional that the baddies morphed into comic book characters straight out of 80's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cartoons. Rocksteady and Bebop would have fit right in with these guys, and seemed to be the inspiration for the cadence of some of the dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe prose throughout would have benefited from several more rounds of editing. I picked up at least three or four major typos - a small amount to be sure, but more than you'd expect from a wide release from a large publisher. The errors didn't end with typos and spelling, but extended into point of view problems and sudden tense shifts. Even the name of the main city - spelled \"Tabula Ro$a\" throughout the majority of the book - was spelled randomly as either \"Tabula Rosa\" or \"Tabula Ro$a\" towards the end.\r\n\r\nAll of these quibbles can be excused to a certain extent if the story moves quickly and amuses, but FV&amp;FS strangely spends most of its time watching characters sitting around having discussions: what happened in the past, what they might do in the future, etc. The book is at its best when actual action is being presented, which is regretfully not often - and that really leaves the reader plenty of time to focus on the poor workmanship presented throughout.\r\n\r\nThere is some fun to be had with the book, but not nearly enough to justify its length. Shaving off 100 pages or so and rewriting the prose until it ceased to sound like direct transcriptions from audio notes may have turned a so-so book into something special, but as-is this book is a flawed experience. Seldom have I read a book that feels like such a last-minute, \"weld whatever we've got together by the deadline\"rush job, but I'd bet money that's exactly what happened here.\r\n\r\nI'm still a David Wong fan, and I'll buy the next book he publishes, but here's hoping the next one is polished more thoroughly before it's released to the public.\r\n    \";s:6:\"rating\";i:3;s:5:\"likes\";i:14;}i:6;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:4102:\"Well, that was definitely one hell of a fast paced, action packed, and downright crazy novel.

Seriously, there was not one moment of calm throughout the entirety of the novel.

It feels more like a satire of the action genre which is completely refreshing and unlike anything I have ever read before. It was crude and funny and really pushed the limits in terms of humour!\r\n\r\nEvery chapter left off with a little mini-cliffhanger that made it impossible to put the book down after finishing a chapter. As mentioned before, the story is super fast paced and adventurous. It reminded me a lot of Ready Player One in the sense that the characters were always in search of something and were constantly racing against one another to get it.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed all of the characters within Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits! Zoey was a strong female lead that took no shit from anyone around her. She was hilarious and really added fantastic comic relief throughout the novel. Will Blackwater reminded me a lot of Matt Bomer circa White Collar with a dash of Tom Hiddleston. I loved his character purely because he was the complete opposite of Zoey. Where she was blunt and sarcastic, he was calm, collected and serious. I also really loved Armando, Zoey\u2019s hired bodyguard to protect her from those who want her father\u2019s fortune. There were so many other characters that added to the overall story such as Echo, Andre and Carlton.\r\n\r\nOf course there was also the evil bad guy. Well technically, there were multiple evil bad guys, but there was the one pivotal villain, Molech. Typically one hates the super villain of any story, and don\u2019t get me wrong, Molech did PLENTY to make me hate him as a character, but he was also one of the most entertaining characters to read during this story. He definitely was not the sharpest tool in the shed and to see him get frustrated while Zoey taunts him with her wit, were probably some of the best moments in this novel.\r\n\r\nThe story started to get a little hectic towards the end. There were moments that could have been explained with slightly more detail, especially during the final few scenes. I felt it ended a little too abruptly with a few questions I had still left unanswered.\r\n\r\nI could definitely see this series continuing, and David Wong\u2019s hilarious Author Afterword confirmed that there is definitely a possibility for a sequel! I have never read Wong\u2019s other work, including the popular John Dies at the End, but I do have it sitting on my shelf and I am definitely going to be reading it soon! I loved Wong\u2019s writing style and I can\u2019t wait to devour more!\r\n\r\nI want to quickly thank my best friend Heather who recommended this book to me and kindly let me borrow her copy! Sorry I kept it so long before reading it, but it was definitely worth it!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nInitial post-reading thoughts:\r\n\r\nThis was definitely a super fun, action packed and fast paced story! Each chapter ended with a tiny cliffhanger that made you want to continue reading immediately. The characters within this story were all pretty fantastic and well thought out.

I was gifted this by the lovely Elena at christmas time and I picked up the audiobook too so I could listen to this whilst I was working. I liked the narrator, but honestly it was the story which really hooked me in and I read through nearly all of this mostly over two long days where I was working and listening to the audiobook.\r\n\r\nThis tells the story of Zoey Ashe who is basically an average 'poor girl' stereotype until one day her estranged multi-billionaire father dies and she immediately becomes a target. The world Zoey lives in has been fairly normal up to this point, she's not thought much of her father for ditching them, but she's also had a good relationship with her slightly-too-ditsy mother and they have an understanding about how they live.\r\nZoey's world is shaken to its core when the new blink livestreams get involved (basically everyone in the city she goes to for the funeral has one causing a full network of cameras following people everywhere) and she's immediately target no. 1 for all the criminals who want her father's money. The book opens with her being stalked by a psychopath killer and this is a running theme throughout the whole book.\r\n\r\nHonestly the world-building and technology for this book drew me in most. It's a hyper-tech society with so much new stuff constantly being invented and streamed and used and this creates a centre for crime to become entertainment and for the masses to tune in to real-time crime. The police are basically non-existant, and there's a complete risk for Zoey's life most of the time.\r\n\r\nWith that said and despite the world building being super cool I did feel that we had the same problem occur multiple times within this story and although I warmed to Zoey and her smelly cat as the story went on, she didn't become a character I hugely worried about and this left me with a slight disconnect still.\r\n\r\nI think if you want something that's going to truly amuse and entertain you then this is a fab book for that. It has action, action and more action and there are also a few moments which made me laugh aloud. I also think if you want a more 'believable' or character-driven story then this maybe won't be for you so if you go into it expecting that you'd be disappointed. For me, this was bizarre, wacky and filled with fun and it was great to help me power through the workload. 3.5*s overall and a likeable read for sure!    \";s:6:\"rating\";i:3;s:5:\"likes\";i:9;}i:9;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:225:\"Oh my god a new book!!

It is a world of omnipresent social media, where everyone is desperately seeking the spotlight. Anything goes when it comes to attracting viewers to one\u2019s video feed as provided by the omnipresent Blink cameras. It is a world of ever more elaborate advertising campaigns for ever-simpler products.\r\n\r\nZoey Ashe is a young lady going nowhere. She and her useless humanities degree are sleeping on a futon at her stripper mom\u2019s place in the trailer park. Her dead-end barista job is providing her with just enough to get by. Her cat is incredibly smelly.\r\n\r\nBut when it turns out that Zoey\u2019s sketchy deadbeat father is Arthur Livingston, the incredibly wealthy progenitor of the lawless high-tech desert city of Tabula Ra$a (and yes, that really is a dollar sign), her life becomes considerably more complicated. See, Arthur\u2019s dead, and it seems that there\u2019s only one way to gain access to his mysterious vault \u2013 through Zoey.\r\n\r\nAnd so she becomes a target for good guys and bad guys alike. She\u2019s forced to take up with her father\u2019s former associates \u2013 known as The Fancy Suits \u2013 in an effort to keep one particular self-styled supervillain named Molech from gaining access to her father\u2019s most closely guarded secret \u2026 a secret that, in the wrong hands, could lead to the end of civilization.\r\n\r\nWong\u2019s comedic bona fides are legit; if he had written \u201cFuturistic Violence and Fancy Suits\u201d as simply a genre parody filled with trope-mocking jokes and off-color repartee, it would have been a perfectly enjoyable read. And make no mistake \u2013 this is a very funny book.\r\n\r\nHowever, rather than take the easy route, the author has instead devoted considerable energies to a detailed construction (and subsequent deconstruction) of a near-future that manages to feel both utterly outlandish and surprisingly plausible. This world is best realized in the shining sprawl of the delightfully-named Tabula Ra$a, a place of never-ending boom construction where buildings are planned, built and razed without ever seeing a tenant. The very landscape plays host to a constant deluge of holographic advertisements. The population is devoted to wearable tech that is constantly broadcasting their lives into the ether, as well as watching the feeds of others they deem more interesting. The line of demarcation between haves and have-nots is far wider and more distinct than ever.\r\n\r\nBy dropping the unwilling Zoey into the midst of this barely controlled chaos, \u201cFuturistic Violence and Fancy Suits\u201d is able to shine satirically (though worry not \u2013 there are plenty of inappropriate cursewords and d\u2014k jokes, too). It\u2019s a wonderful look at one logical aftermath of our current society\u2019s obsessions with money and technology and reality television and superheroes and whatnot. Wong\u2019s extrapolation of our present is profane and ridiculous and remarkably telling.\r\n\r\nThe character dynamics, meanwhile, are compelling in their own right. By making his focal point someone with no experience as a focal point \u2013 and one almost as unfamiliar with this world as the reader is to boot \u2013 Wong offers us a way in. And through Zoey\u2019s interactions with the powerful and mysterious strangers that surround her, the hero\u2019s journey unfolds.\r\n\r\n\u201cFuturistic Violence and Fancy Suits\u201d manages to elicit laughter while still having something to say. It\u2019s an impressive feat, as well as an engaging one. Funny and thought-provoking, crass and heartfelt, it might not be for everyone, but if it\u2019s for you \u2026 it\u2019s REALLY for you.

I loved lots of things about it when I read it but my writer's brain had a hard time dealing with the crazy all over the place structure and lack of editing. The version I read was compiled from a serialized blog, and it showed in lots of ways. For that reason I liked the movie a little better.\r\nIt was good enough with enough interesting ideas that a whim I checked out the new Wong novel at library. Futuristic violence and fancy suits is pretty gonzo but not nearly as Gonzo as his debut novel.\r\n\r\nThe story of Zoey Ashe and her cat Stink Machine, although Stink Machine is not in the novel as much I thought he should have been. Zoey is the daughter of a single mom and former stripper. She only met her father twice who is a wealthy mobster in the pop-up wanna-be vegas of the future called Tolba Ro$a. The story starts as Zoey suddenly has killers and hitmen chasing after her. Eventually she learns that her father left her his empire. This rags to riches techo thriller cyber-noir is not as funny as I expected after reading JDATE. From there we get super-humans, high tech battles and chases and much more.\r\n\r\nKinda bugged me Stink Machine didn't play a bigger role and kinda gets ignored in the second half. Don't get me wrong I laughed a few times and it was interesting enough to finish but I felt the first act was the strongest. That said the opening line of chapter 4 is one of the best laughs I got in the book. Also a speech given by the lead villain (p.264) at the end. Besides a few moments like that I was a little disappointed.\r\n\r\nI have seen alot of comments online about the editing of this book. Perhaps this a sore subject for me as my novels have not received the most intense editing, and I for one don't have a great eye for grammar. I catch many of these typos when I read books, but that to me has nothing to do with a story. If the story is good I will over look nitpicks. Was I entertained? Sure I was and typos aside this was better edited to me in the sense that it felt more structured like a novel. To me the big issue with editors in relation to Wong's work is the structure. I felt John Dies at The End didn't flow as novel. It felt like the chapter were pulled out of different books, sometimes it felt like a different writer. It distracted me while reading. I felt that book needed another draft.\r\n\r\nI think some will be disappointed by this book, I think it was a better novel than his debut, but I think it is not as fun a experience.    \";s:6:\"rating\";i:3;s:5:\"likes\";i:2;}i:23;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:1853:\"\"Man, you got a drinking problem.

Those two books both explore the adventures of two guys in a town where strange, world-threatening things happen, and only they can see it. They're inventive, weird, funny, memorable, great books.\r\n\r\nFuturistic Violence is not. It's not even really close to how good Wong's first two books are. His first two books were 4 or 5-star books, really really good. Futuristic Violence is I'd say about 2, maybe 3, stars: solid effort, not a terrible book, but not particularly memorable.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest flaw here is that the story seems so typical. I don't know, really, why I say that, except that as I read this book I kept thinking I'd read the same story, or watched the same movie, or seen the same thing, a thousand times before. \r\n\r\nThe basic plot is this: Zoey, a trailer-trash girl, gets set upon by a strange, psycho killer with mechanical jaws. She is mysteriously rescued -- or not! -- by some guys who intervene, and within a day or so she's off to \"Tabula Rasa,\" a city where billionaires live essentially without law. She finds her dad was a billionaire himself, and that he is also dead. She hated her dad, who she'd only met twice in her life, but is [SPOILER ALERT] left his entire estate. The only problem is, there is a crazy thug named \"Molech\" who wants her dead, for reasons that ultimately are sort of ill-explained. Zoey eventually decides to work with her dad's inner circle, a gang of toughs called \"The Suits\" to fight Molech.\r\n\r\nIt all felt very cookie-cutterish and, for the first part of the book, somewhat annoying. Zoey is not a particularly likeable character. Wong has her spend about the first 1\/3 whining, complaining, and generally saying she can't believe it and must be dreaming -- that latter one being a pet peeve of mine. Maybe I'm different than other people, but if I woke up tomorrow and learned that some relative of mine had left me billions of dollars, not for one second would I think I must be dreaming. As I've said before, I don't know anyone who has ever thought anything happening to them, good or bad, was happening in a dream. People don't work that way, and authors should knock it off. Just have people accept that life is real, okay? It doesn't add to the drama or fun or excitement of a book to have a character repeatedly say I must be dreaming.\r\n\r\nZoey's characterization isn't the only more-or-less-stock character. \"The Suits\" include an actual Asian woman who wears tight sexy clothes and is a computer genius, a large flamboyant black guy who is all muscle but also all heart, a Texan type who basically is described as a real-life Yosemite Sam, and \"Will,\" who wears suits everywhere he goes, is always drinking scotch, and is the type of guy who is always three steps ahead of everyone else. Again, this all feels incredibly recycled.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for the villains, the side characters, all the rest of it: it feels like it's been done a million times before. Everything happens about as it's supposed to, with few surprises along the way. (One surprise was that Wong didn't fall into the usual trope of introducing a seemingly random character only to have that person save the day: at one point, Zoey is rescued, sort of, by a construction crew, and the episode felt so purposefully set up that I assumed at the end the construction crew would somehow save her or help her out. They never showed up again. Even with that Wong couldn't avoid temptation at every turn: a pair of white tigers mentioned frequently throughout the book show up at the very end at exactly where they're supposed to.)\r\n\r\nEven though it's been done before, the book is written and paced to keep it moving. A generic action book with well-written action sequences and good pacing isn't the worst thing in the world. But it was a letdown after the comic excellence of Wong's first two books. Those books felt far more creative, fresh, and unique than this one.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to like this book. I've been trying, in this review, to come up with some reason to recommend it or rate it higher than I should. I think, though, that's just residual good feeling from Wong's earlier work. I don't feel ripped off or like I wasted my time reading this one, but it's not like I'll recommend it to anyone, either.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it seems like the purposely generic title is, in fact, fitting: this is a book that you can in fact judge by its cover.    \";s:6:\"rating\";i:2;s:5:\"likes\";i:2;}i:26;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:6533:\"This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers.

It's not really a horror book, and while there's a lot of gore to be found, it doesn't bear the quality or effect of the horror in the John and Dave books. But that's OK, it's more of a sci-fi thriller instead, and that can work.\r\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat fun, and most of the dialogue is even entertaining, with the exception of almost any scenes with Molech, the main antagonist. Every thing the guy said was stupid, overtly rapey, and completely hypocritical (returning the world to a natural state where the strong prey upon the weak and men are fueled by adrenaline and fury by completely surrendering to advanced cybernetic implants makes no level of sense). \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of unforgivable sins in this book, though. From a literary standpoint, the worst is the deus ex machina device that ends up winning the day that should have been discovered well within the conflict deadline; the only saving grace is that this gives time for some fun interactions to show Molech for the ridiculous tantrum spectacle he is. Still is the most severe sin as any reliance on last minute deus ex machina devices is a cop-out and stinks of writing yourself into a corner.\r\n\r\nClose behind this in severity is the tease, the hint throughout the book that there is a traitor, an informant in their midst, with the reveal being that the traitor was the gardener, who had never been mentioned, hadn't been around any of the protagonists' planning sessions, and hadn't even been mentioned as background information for the entire novel up until his reveal within the last fifty pages, and his subsequent death by antagonist on the following page. It feels like this was a plot point remembered at the last minute, played off as a joke to cover bases that should have been solidified throughout the entire process of writing. \r\n\r\nThe final sticking point for me is more of a personal knowledge one, in that Molech and his men were glass cannons, capable of being killed by common handgun rounds, and even crossbows in the finale. With that said, an attempt was made to address this through antagonist's mystery device that detonates all ammunition around, first in a 300 yard radius, then in a city-wide area (or so I assume, it's never really specified the second time.\r\n\r\nThis brings up some sticking issues. The first time, there are private security snipers set up on rooftops (described earlier as towering skyscrapers, likely higher than 30 stories) around the area waiting for signs of hostility and with several known targets. Molech appears with quite an entrance, activates a device, guns in the area blow, injuring several. Hostilities are now declared, snipers are out of range of the device, but well within rifle range, Molech and his goons die with several large caliber holes in them. Or rather, that should have happened, but apparently, the snipers were all on skyscrapers miraculously shorter than 30 stories and right on top of the device.\r\n\r\nWhatever. We'll allow this battle as a framing device, to establish that Molech has some crazy gear. So why, with this entire incident being displayed on the Blink network from a variety of angles showing the device, the carnage, and the effect on firearms, do none of the major security networks pick up non-conventional ranged weapons? In our current time, we have developed nearly man- portable electromagnetic gauss and rail weapons (albeit prohibitively expensive ones compared to conventional firearms) capable of killing or incapacitating a man. We even have air rifles you can hunt buffalo with, and have had that capability since pioneer days. For f***'s sake, even crossbows are mentioned in the book, unfortunately wielded by morons with no training. Any and all of these weapons are currently civilian legal in the United States, so in the extremist libertarian city of Tabula Ra$a, these should have been available to all security forces immediately upon the threat of attack against them. Molech and his goons roll up, make a show, are met with disciplined, rapid fire, and die with several large caliber holes in them.\r\n\r\nThis antagonist has been played up as a god, but still has mostly mortal reflexes, mortal frame, and mortal toughness. David Wong has utilized true supernatural threats before in his work, the unknown nature of which allowed a sense of doom, dread, and impending death to develop against immortal, innumerable, and inevitable threats. Molech has none of these qualities, and yet is treated as unstoppable. Meanwhile, as stated, easily available techniques to counter his capabilities exist, and would be readily available to someone who is one of the richest people in the world, and would be thought of by the crew that serves her whose members are regarded as legend.\r\n\r\nI don't know, I'm not a writer. But I regard the status of protagonists by the capabilities of their antagonists. Zoey and her crack team are defeated by a moronic fratboy and his thugs with some lightning powers and super strength, whose penchant for rapey monologues still lets them run circles around him until the final 50 pages. I am impressed with no one in this situation. The only thing preventing any one of them from dying at any of a dozen conflict points is the incompetence of the opposition.\r\n\r\nIn closing, the more I think back on this book, the more I dislike it, especially when held up to it's far superior cousins, the John and Dave books. A few funny moments and some amusing dialogue is not going to make up for weak story, forgotten plot points, and a pathetic deus ex machina save at the end.     \";s:6:\"rating\";i:2;s:5:\"likes\";i:2;}i:27;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:7:\"content\";s:1477:\"Only four stars on this one because my expectations were outrageously high.
